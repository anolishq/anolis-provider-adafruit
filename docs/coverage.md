# Coverage: candidate Adafruit boards

Which Adafruit I2C boards this provider could support, grouped by the chip and
the Adafruit CircuitPython driver that runs it, not by SKU. One driver usually
covers several boards, so a row here is one unit of work: a module in
`devices/` as described in [adding-a-board.md](adding-a-board.md).

Supported today: `bme280`, `bmp3xx`, `lps22`, `motor_hat` (PCA9685 with
`adafruit-circuitpython-motor`), `mpu6050`, `sht3x`, `sht4x` and `shtc3`.
Everything else is a candidate.

Sources, all retrieved 2026-11-03:

- The CircuitPython library bundle's `.gitmodules`
  (`adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle`, `main`): the driver list.
- Each listed driver's `README.rst`, `pyproject.toml` and main module source,
  from its repository's `main` branch: PyPI name, product links, default
  address.
- Adafruit's STEMMA QT shop category (adafruit.com/category/1018) and its
  three subcategories: product names and numbers.
- `adafruit/awesome-stemma`, `awesome-stemma-qt.md`: Adafruit's curated list.
- Product pages for #4280 and #6318, where the chip or a board
  feature was not in the driver source.

"Product numbers" are Adafruit's product IDs (adafruit.com/product/N). An
address is the driver's default as written in its source; "alt" addresses are
the ones the source names. Where a fact came from somewhere else, the cell
says so. Where no fetched source stated it, the cell says **unconfirmed**.

## Actuators and outputs

| Chip / family | PyPI driver | Example boards (#) | I2C address | Notes for Anolis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PCA9685 16-channel PWM, DC motors via TB6612 | `adafruit-circuitpython-pca9685`, `-motor`, `-motorkit` | DC & Stepper Motor HAT (2348) **supported as `motor_hat`**; DC Motor + Stepper FeatherWing (2927); Motor/Stepper/Servo Shield v2 (1438); DC & Stepper Motor Bonnet (4280) | MotorKit default 0x60 | Throttle 0 brakes, `None` coasts (`adafruit_motor.motor`). No command watchdog: outputs hold their last value unless something writes them, so `motor_hat` brakes every terminal in the provider's `stop()`, and after a `SIGKILL` or a crash of the provider they hold. The FeatherWing and Shield share the HAT's driver, so they are a config entry, not a module. Bonnet: the product page says a "dedicated PWM driver chip" without naming it, and MotorKit's docstring does not list it, so PCA9685 is **unconfirmed** for 4280. |
| PCA9685 16-channel PWM, servos and raw PWM | `adafruit-circuitpython-pca9685`, `-motor`, `-servokit` | 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver (815); 16-Channel PWM/Servo HAT (2327); PWM/Servo Bonnet (3416); PWM/Servo Shield (1411); 8-Channel PWM/Servo FeatherWing (2928) | 0x40 default (driver and ServoKit) | A servo angle of 0 is a position, not a safe state. The off state is no pulse (`fraction = None` writes duty 0 in `adafruit_motor.servo`). The zero rung needs a numeric argument where 0 is safe, so expose pulse width or duty (0 = no pulse), not angle. Same chip and register model as `motor_hat`, so the mock fake already exists. No watchdog. |
| MCP23017 driving 8 low-side MOSFETs (solenoids) | `adafruit-circuitpython-mcp230xx` | I2C to 8 Channel Solenoid Driver (6318) | 0x20 default; 3 address jumpers, up to 8 boards (product page) | Output low = solenoid off. Port B is spare GPIO (product page). MCP23017 power-on pin direction not checked against the datasheet: **unconfirmed** that outputs are off before the provider connects. No watchdog. Same driver as the GPIO expanders below. |
| DRV2605L haptic driver | `adafruit-circuitpython-drv2605` | DRV2605L Haptic Motor Controller (2305) | 0x5A | Plays effects rather than holding a level; low value for a lab rig. |
| EMC2101 fan controller + temperature | `adafruit-circuitpython-emc2101` | EMC2101 PC Fan Controller (4808) | 0x4C (fixed in driver) | 0 % fan is not necessarily safe if the fan cools something; decide per rig. Also a temperature sensor. |
| MCP4728 quad 12-bit DAC | `adafruit-circuitpython-mcp4728` | MCP4728 Quad DAC with EEPROM (4470) | 0x60 default | 0 V output. Power-up values come from on-chip EEPROM (driver: `save_to_eeprom` sets "defaults on power up"), so the board can start non-zero if someone saved values: drive 0 on connect. |
| MCP4725 12-bit DAC | `adafruit-circuitpython-mcp4725` | MCP4725 breakout (935) | 0x62 default | 0 V output. Not in the STEMMA QT category. |
| AD5693R 16-bit DAC | `adafruit-circuitpython-ad569x` | AD5693R Breakout (5811) | 0x4C | 0 V output. |
| DAC7578 / DAC6578 8-channel DAC | `adafruit-circuitpython-dacx578` | DAC7578 Breakout (6223); DAC6578 Breakout (6258) | 0x4C (constant; a docstring in the same file says 0x47) | 0 V output. 6258 is not linked from the driver; it is matched by name only. |
| GP8403 2-channel 0-10 V DAC | `adafruit-circuitpython-gp8403` | GP8403 I2C DAC with 12V Booster + NVM (6516) | 0x58 | 0-10 V is the common analog setpoint input on lab and industrial kit. Power-up value comes from NVM; writing NVM needs a bit-banged waveform on raw pins (driver docstring), which the provider should not do. Drive 0 on connect. |
| PCF8591 4-ch 8-bit ADC + 1 DAC | `adafruit-circuitpython-pcf8591` | PCF8591 Quad ADC + DAC (4648) | 0x48 | Also listed under analog in. |
| ADG728 / ADG729 analog matrix switch | `adafruit-circuitpython-adg72x` | ADG728 1-to-8 (5899); ADG729 dual 1-to-4 (5932) | ADG728 0x4C, ADG729 0x44 | Routes signals rather than driving a load. "All open" is the natural safe state, but 0 is a channel index, so it needs a per-channel function to fit the zero rung. |

No Adafruit relay board appeared in the STEMMA QT category (searched names for
`relay`; see How this was counted).

## Discrete I/O (GPIO expanders)

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MCP23017 / MCP23008 | `adafruit-circuitpython-mcp230xx` | MCP23017 GPIO Expander Breakout (5346); GPIO Expander Bonnet (4132); Solenoid Driver (6318) | 0x20 default | One driver covers three boards here. Pin-change interrupt pins exist on the chip; using them is out of scope (needs a host GPIO). Poll instead. |
| PCF8574 / PCF8575 | `adafruit-circuitpython-pcf8574`, `-pcf8575` | PCF8574 Expander (5545); PCF8575 16 GPIO Expander (5611) | 0x20 default | Quasi-bidirectional pins: "output high" is a weak pull-up, so read-back of an output is the pin level, not the latch. |
| AW9523 | `adafruit-circuitpython-aw9523` | AW9523 GPIO Expander and LED Driver (4886) | 0x58 default | Pins can run as constant-current LED drivers. |

## Bus infrastructure

| Chip / family | PyPI driver | Example boards (#) | I2C address | Notes for Anolis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TCA9548A / PCA9548 8-channel mux | `adafruit-circuitpython-tca9548a` | PCA9548 8-Channel Mux (5626); TCA9548A (2717, linked from driver) | 0x70 default | **Bus device.** The provider has to own channel selection and give each board behind it a bus handle (the driver's `TCA9548A_Channel` is one). This is how several 0x29 ToF sensors or two SCD4x share a bus. Config schema needs a `bus: {mux, channel}` field. |
| PCA9546 4-channel mux | `adafruit-circuitpython-tca9548a` (**unconfirmed**: the driver source names only TCA9548A) | PCA9546 4-Channel Mux (5664) | | Same handling as above if the driver works with it. |
| LTC4316 address translator | none needed | LTC4316 I2C Address Translator (5914) | translates by jumper | Transparent: the provider sees the translated address. The config schema's address list per board would have to allow it. |
| ISO1540 isolator, LTC4311 terminator, TCA4307 hot-swap buffer, level shifters | none needed | ISO1540 (4903); LTC4311 (4756); TCA4307 (5159); 3V-to-5V (5649), 5V-to-3V (5637) | | Passive to software. Worth recommending in the hardware guide (isolation and hot-swap matter on rigs). |

## Other

| Chip / family | PyPI driver | Example boards (#) | I2C address | Notes for Anolis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DS3502 / DS1841 digital potentiometers | `-ds3502`, `-ds1841` | DS3502 (4286); DS1841 (4570) | 0x28 | An output: wiper position. Safe value depends on the circuit. |
| RTCs: DS3231, PCF8523, RV-8803 | `-ds3231`, `-pcf8523`, `-rv8803` | DS3231 (5188); PCF8523 (5189); RV-8803 (6538) | RV-8803 0x32; others **unconfirmed** | The host clock is usually better; low value. |
| EEPROM / FRAM, ATECC608, Si5351, S-35710 | `-24lc32`, `-fram`, `-atecc`, `-si5351`, `-s35710` | 24LC32 (5146); ATECC608 (4314); Si5351A (5640); S-35710 (5959) | 0x50; ; ; 0x60; 0x32 | Not runtime devices. |
| PA1010D GPS | `adafruit-circuitpython-gps` | Mini GPS PA1010D (4415) | 0x10 | Also UART; I2C works. Low value for a lab. |

## Suggested order

Ranked by value per effort for a lab-automation runtime.

1. **PCA9685 servo/PWM** (815, 2327, 3416, 1411, 2928). Same chip and fake as
   `motor_hat`; adds servos and raw PWM. The design work is the pulse-width
   function shape that makes 0 mean "no pulse".
2. **MotorKit siblings** (2927, 1438). No new code beyond declaring the boards
   on the `motor_hat` module. Do this alongside 1.
3. **MCP230xx** (5346, 4132, 6318). One driver gives GPIO and the solenoid
   driver, whose safe state (output low, solenoid off) is unambiguous.
4. **INA219 / INA2xx** power monitors. Every rig has a rail worth watching;
   INA219 alone is one small register model.
5. **SCD4x** (5187, 5190, 6512). Three boards on one driver; CO2 is the
   commonest enclosure reading after temperature and humidity. (SHT4x and SHTC3
   are done.)
6. **NAU7802** load cell (4538). Weighing is frequent in bench automation.
7. **TCA9548A mux**. Not a sensor, but it unlocks duplicates of everything
   above. Needs a design decision in the config schema first.
8. **MCP9600 thermocouple** and **DAC family** (MCP4728, GP8403). Heater and
   setpoint control; the DACs need the "drive 0 on connect" rule because they
   restore stored values at power-up.

Next tier: LSM6DS (eight boards, one driver), seesaw input boards, ADS1x15
once its board numbers are confirmed.

## How this was counted

Counted on 2026-11-03 from the sources above, fetched fresh; the scripts and
downloads were not kept in this repository, so each method below names what
was read rather than a file to rerun.

| Figure | Value | Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bundle driver submodules | 277 | `path` lines in the bundle's `.gitmodules` under `libraries/drivers/` |
| Bundle helper submodules (MotorKit, ServoKit, Motor live here) | 135 | the same, under `libraries/helpers/` |
| Bundle drivers whose source or README mentions I2C | 191 (182 by source, 9 by README only) | a search of each driver's main module and README for I2C. **Estimate**: it misses packages whose `__init__.py` is empty (it reports `cap1188`, `atecc`, `neotrellis` as non-I2C, which they are not). |
| Products in the STEMMA QT category page | 309 distinct product IDs | product IDs parsed from the category page's product links. The page's subcategory labels read Devices and Sensors (200), Controllers (91), Cables and Connectors (19); parsing each subcategory page gives the same 200 / 91 / 19, which sum to 310 because 5681 is listed in two subcategories. |
| Devices and Sensors products linked by product number from a bundle driver's README or module docstring | 108 of 200 | the Devices and Sensors product IDs joined against product links in driver READMEs and docstrings. The other 92 are matched to a driver by name in the tables above, or not at all. |
| awesome-stemma-qt rows | 91 sensors, 55 devices, 26 displays | table rows per section of the list. The list is curated and lags the shop (e.g. it has no PCA9685 or Motor HAT, which are not STEMMA QT). |
| Relay boards in the STEMMA QT category | 0 | a case-insensitive search for `relay` over the category's product names: no match (exit status 1 confirmed); the same search for `solenoid` matches 6318. |

Not counted: Adafruit's whole I2C range outside the STEMMA QT category. The
motor and servo boards above (815, 2348, 2327, 3416, 1411, 2927, 2928, 1438)
come from driver docstrings, not the category, because most of them have no
STEMMA QT connector.
